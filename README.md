A framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML. [Check out the live demo](http://revealjs.com/).

reveal.js comes with a broad range of features including [nested slides](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markup), [Markdown contents](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown), [PDF export](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export), [speaker notes](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#speaker-notes) and a [JavaScript API](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#api). There's also a fully featured visual editor and platform for sharing reveal.js presentations at [slides.com](https://slides.com?ref=github).


## Online Editor

Presentations are written using HTML or Markdown but there's also an online editor for those of you who prefer a graphical interface. Give it a try at [https://slides.com](https://slides.com?ref=github).


## Installation

The **basic setup** is for authoring presentations only. The **full setup** gives you access to all reveal.js features and plugins such as speaker notes as well as the development tasks needed to make changes to the source.

### Basic setup

The core of reveal.js is very easy to install. You'll simply need to download a copy of this repository and open the index.html file directly in your browser.

1. Download the latest version of reveal.js from <https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases>
2. Unzip and replace the example contents in index.html with your own
3. Open index.html in a browser to view it

### Full setup

Some reveal.js features, like external Markdown and speaker notes, require that presentations run from a local web server. The following instructions will set up such a server as well as all of the development tasks needed to make edits to the reveal.js source code.

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (4.0.0 or later)

1. Clone the reveal.js repository
   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git
   ```

1. Navigate to the reveal.js folder
   ```sh
   $ cd reveal.js
   ```

1. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   $ npm install
   ```

1. Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes
   ```sh
   $ npm start
   ```

1. Open <http://localhost:8000> to view your presentation

   You can change the port by using `npm start -- --port=8001`.
